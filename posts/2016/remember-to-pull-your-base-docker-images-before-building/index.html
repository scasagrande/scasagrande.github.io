At work I was recently debugging some docker containers that were being built nightly by Jenkins. These were actually the same images that I was building in my last article.
After making the changes that I mentioned in that article, I noticed that the resulting containers for argon were having no issues, but builds of our app using latest were having issues finding a package. So I built our app container locally and I dived in to see what was wrong.">

<p>At work I was recently debugging some docker containers that were being built nightly by Jenkins. These were actually the same images that I was building <a href="https://steven.casagrande.io/posts/2016/automatically-building-docker-containers-with-different-base-image-tags/" >in my last article</a>.</p>
<p>After making the changes that I mentioned in that article, I noticed that the resulting containers for <code>argon</code> were having no issues, but builds of our app using <code>latest</code> were having issues finding a package. So I built our app container locally and I dived in to see what was wrong.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ docker run --rm -i -t --entrypoint<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/bin/bash&#34;</span> container-name
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This let me get a prompt inside the container to take a look at what the problem was. First I looked inside the <code>node_modules</code> folder to see if the package was messed up. What I instead noticed was that the container was missing a bunch of our dependencies! Then I got suspicious&hellip;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ node --version
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>4.1.2
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>What the fuck. This should be <code>5.10.1</code></p>
<p>So I re-triggered the Jenkins job, blew everything away locally and re-pulled the <code>baseimage:latest</code> that Jenkins just built.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ docker run --rm -i -t --entrypoint<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/bin/bash&#34;</span> baseimage:latest
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"></span># node --version
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>4.1.2
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>FUCK</p>
<p>So I check the Jenkins build log. Yes, it correctly spits out <code>FROM node:latest</code> when building the image. It pushes everything correctly. No errors, no typos.</p>
<p>So I explicitly compare what I was running before in the Dockerfile to what I was running now. Before it was actually this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-Dockerfile" data-lang="Dockerfile"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">FROM</span><span style="color:#e6db74"> node:5</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>And now its:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-Dockerfile" data-lang="Dockerfile"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">FROM</span><span style="color:#e6db74"> node:latest</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Currently, those point to the same image on Docker hub. It was at this point though that I realised what was going on. At some point months ago someone on this Jenkins box did a <code>docker pull node</code>. Then at build time, when docker read the <code>FROM node:latest</code> line, it would check locally, see the image, and just use that.</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t a problem before because <code>FROM node:5</code> would look locally, but not see anything tagged <code>node:5</code>. It would then pull it from Docker Hub, but not save the tag on the server! Thus, every time it ran it would re-pull the latest 5 release container.</p>
<p>So the solution? Be explicit in what your project needs in your automated builds. Pull your base images before attempting to use them.</p>

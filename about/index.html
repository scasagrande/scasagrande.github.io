Nov 2023 - Current

Moved to a new role as lead build systems developer to focus full-time on the build infrastructure.
Continued to improve and maintain the bazel build system. This solid foundation allowed several teams to rapidly and confidently test, integrate, and deploy our generation-3 runtime code, culminating in our impressive CLOPs performance improvement announcement as part of QDC 2024.
Ran feedback sessions with developers to better understand their pain points. Then using contradiction analysis I provided detailed plans on what the path forward would be.

</h2>
<p>Nov 2020 - Oct 2023</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved the CI process for an existing critical software component, reducing CI build times from over an hour down to less than 10min and improved test reliability.</li>
<li>Standardized the build and test process for Python language projects.</li>
<li>Used contradiction analysis to determine the best course of action for our next generation of software development. I came to the conclusion that we needed a solid foundation to build on, and that would be a monorepo+bazel approach.</li>
<li>Independently researched, advocated for, implemented, and deployed a monorepo+bazel migration for our next generation critical software components. This work was done after development had already started, and I needed to maintain parallel build systems across several repositories until the migration was complete.</li>

</h2>
<p>March 2019 - Oct 2020</p>
<ul>
<li>Took ownership of the company direction with respect to test automation.</li>
<li>Increased automated backend regression coverage from less than 1% to approximately 75%, while simultaneously vastly increasing test permutations and individual test assertions.</li>
<li>Created tools for internal use to decrease manual test setup time. This provided a 1 click, reproducible, and reuseable way to setup and share test configurations throughout the organization.</li>
<li>Reduced release cycle regression test time from several weeks, utilizing multiple full time staff and 4 co-op students, down to approximately two weeks with reduced full time staff focus and only 1 co-op student.</li>
<li>Acted as the first responder for post-merge issues; quickly debugging and sorting failures, and contacting those involved.</li>
<li>Assisted developers company-wide with Python related questions.</li>
<li>Mentored and trained co-op students.</li>
<li>Key techs: Python, unittest, Jenkins, ffmpeg, Bazel, Py36:Typing</li>

</h2>
<p>Jan 2018 - Feb 2019</p>
<ul>
<li>Defined, implemented, and maintained several complete manufacturing test solutions</li>
<li>Programmed configurable test stations featuring an easy to use interface, multiple levels of access, different operational modes, and more. All written in Python 3.6.</li>
<li>Performed runtime analysis on station software to identify bottlenecks to improve cycle time. One example being taking a semi-automated process from 40min, to full-automated 20min, to 13min optimized.</li>
<li>Built a complete Python based library for station software to easily log test data to the manufacturing database, published to an internal PyPI server that I requested. This included tests via pytest, type hinting via Py36 Typing module, and static typing analysis via mypy.</li>
<li>Utilized numpy, pandas, and matplotlib to do basic data analysis on manufacturing data.</li>
<li>Assisted other teams and individuals with Python related issues</li>
<li>Built several one-off tools to help non-programmers gather test &amp; measurement data, featuring a GUI and delivered as a single executable, written in Python.</li>
<li>Facilitated DFT reviews with design and production teams.</li>
<li>Lead team wide conversations about test station software standardization.</li>
<li>Participated in GR&amp;R studies for several process steps.</li>
<li>Helped train technicians and co-op students.</li>

<p>May 2015 - Dec 2017</p>
<ul>
<li>Initiated, designed, and implemented a new test framework to allow teams using Angular.js or React.js to include automated UI tests in their continuous integration process</li>
<li>Devised test plans for the team&rsquo;s projects to aid in regression testing</li>
<li>Convinced a team I recently joined to delay ship date by one month to improve product quality, resulting in a great product and company-wide recognition for my efforts</li>
<li>Promoted a culture of quality through driving continued adoption of quality, meaningful unit tests and code coverage metrics</li>
